# onlinetest/Reactjs


This small project is developed for school online test by using JQuery and Reactjs.

It's easy to code and easy to use. Ok, please download the files.

First you should have npm. If not, you can download [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), and you will have the npm.

In the login page, I use Ajax of JQuery to get the data from "userData.json" file. So you should input the right name
and password to login. I will show your all the files below, you can also search the content of "userData.json" in your
downloaded folder.
